        <span style="font-size: 2rem"> I </span> had been an introvert lately,
        and talkng to others felt to be an great deal for me. For as much as i
        would love to connect with others to hear about the gems, the stories,
        the experiences they have mined out of life lately, i simply couldn't.
        There are few key things to which i have pondered to like sharing ideas
        and ones own experiences and learning about their experiences isn't
        always easy, especially when we don't agree with each other thoughts.
        Whenever i met them whether it be a club gathering, social-get-together
        with friends or family i always had some disagreement and that was quite
        inevitable. But just because they're missing something or making a
        logical leap it doesn't mean that we have to fight to prove a point.

          CORONA ka ilaz from Whatsapp University</span
        >
      </h2>
      <p>
        So this was a time when pandemic had started in our country. Myself
        being a student in a college had to stay in another city. One day my mom
        called over the phone, being worried about my health, she spoke to me
        about some
        <span style="background-color: yellow"> Home Remedies </span> to cure
        corona at home. And when i asked her from where did she learn about this
        remedy, to my surprise she concluded that was a whatsapp foreward
        message, and she believed in it. Now we being the new generation we know
        it's a fake news. I am sure some of you might be able to relate with me.
        Now here i could have had told her several facts and made her realise
        that she was wrong. But on the contrary i said ok mom i will definitely
        try this and after a while we both disconnected our call. And next day I
        called her and told her that
        <span style="background-color: yellow">
          "Ma yeh wala nuska maine try kiya aur yeh kaam nhi krta"</span
        >
        And i explained her with my theory that Ma this is a type of mask that
        we would need against fighting corona.

      <h2>
        <span style="color: cornflowerblue">
          Now what's the point of this story</span
        >
      </h2>
      <p>
        There are certain arguments, battles, that are not worth winning. So
        rather being arrogant about this that i know better, we must support
        them, we must make it as a collaboration that yes we are in this
        together. We are a team. Because they have lived life from their
        perspective which is different form us. So from this we come to the our
        topic that there is no need to ruin our relationships on small topics.
        There are certain times in our day-to-day life where we could stand to
        prove a point. There are some times when we are fighting our battles,
        winning our battles all together and in that moment we forget that to
        take a decision that which battles should we really fight and which we
        should and i guess this is what it comes from
        <span style="background-color: yellow"> EXPERIENCE.</span> And thus i
        conclude this by saying that
        <span style="background-color: rgb(48, 221, 48)"
